<h5>Stakeholder Info</h5>
<p>I believe that if the project is successful, independent developers of turn-based strategy games can benefit the most. They usually lack the resources the larger companies have in term of playtesting. So this tool can help them playtest and identify issues, problems, or bugs in their level design that they may not find out playtesting themselves due to their prior experiences in similar games. These people tend to work on their own and release their products on platform such as Steam. They are responsible to produce popular games. For turn-based strategy game, the level design is definitely one of the main challenges. It is important for them to find out how difficult or easy the level is both to experienced players and to new players and find a good balance in between. They also want to figure out if the levels have some soft locks or hard locks caused by bugs that may ruin the players' experiences.
The resources they have are great. First, they are most likely extremely experienced in turn-based strategy games, which is why they choose to develop games in this niche genre over other more common options. So they can offer advice on what are some games or even specific levels the tool should be tested on. Not only that, when the tool has a working prototype, these developers probably can offer I/O port for their games so that the tool can be easily used on them, allowing the tool to be tested on a wider variety of games and be more generalized.
