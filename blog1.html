Some products in market include openAI's Gym and Gym Retro, tools developed by openAI that includes the emulator for easy retro game experiments. Some other products are famous projeccts such as MarI/O playing Super Mario World, MariFlow playign Mario Kart. Recently, Starcraft II has become the hot topic and there are several tools trying to play it according to papers such as Tstarbots and Torchcraft. However, I've not found any project or product that specifically focuses on turn-based game and the strategy aspect so that can definitely be improved on.
