    <p>This is the placeholder page for the website of project emblem, my research project for EECS 499. It looks simple, because unfortunately, I have forgotten too much knowledge from EECS 485 last year, so I will take some more time to recall them.</p>
    <p>Project Emblem is trying to use recurrent learning neural network to beat turn-based strategy games. Since turn-based strategy games do not have a difference from the timing of the commands, Project Emblem tries to see if the trained neural network can understand the system of the game and find the optimal strategy to beat the levels.</p>
