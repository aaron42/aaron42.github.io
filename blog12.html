    <h3> Week 13 Blogpost </h3>
    <p> The Design Expo has ended, and this is a reflection on the event.

	During the expo, there has been several people that were interested in the stand. In general, people are curious about the result the project is able to obtain. A lot of people are curious about the setup of the network, such as how the actual implementation of the game is and whether the program is reading the game graphic or not. There was someone that was interested in the technology needed to recreate the project. Overall, people seem to be quite familiar with the game given how popular it is. There is one person that seems to be really experienced in the matter and we discussed the goal of the neural network together. Currently, the network is looking for winning as the only metric. However, it is possible to reward the network for least amount of turns or least level time. That way, the network may develop a different strategy. Quite interestingly, there was a kid that passed by and he was able to identify the game as Fire Emblem. This surprises me a lot as Sacred Stone is so old and the newer Fire Emblem games such as Three Houses has a very different graphic from the game. So his ability to identify the game really surprises me.

	Overall, the showcase was a really fun experience. I did not expect so many people to come by and check but there are a decent amount of people that showed interest. Although it is pretty tiring because we were all one-person team so we had to be standing by the stand for the whole time. But I find the experience to be fun and memorable.
